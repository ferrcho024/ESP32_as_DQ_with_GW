The ESP32 is programmed to function as a node that receives data from a sensor (ESP32_as_Sensor). It then calculates the data quality dimensions, including precision, accuracy, completeness, concordance, and uncertainty. The DF and Nova data are fused using plausibility, and the DQ_Index is calculated. Then, sensor evaluate the values looking for Outliers using an Autoecoder (TensorFlor Lite Micro). Finally, it sends a frame using MQTT that includes: ID,dataFused,"distance",DQIndex are transmitted to topic 80, which represents the number of the nearest SIATA station. The objective is to calculate a spatiotemporally seamless value in collaboration with other sensors near the same SIATA station.
